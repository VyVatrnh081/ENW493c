### 1. Question 1
### ___________ sampling is a probability sample which is distinguished by the following processes: the original population is divided into two or more mutually exclusive and exhaustive subsets (e.g., males and females) and simple random samples of elements from two or more subsets are selected independently of each other.


``Stratified``



Single Random



Cluster



Systematic



### 2. Question 2
### Stratified sampling is a two-step approach where the population is divided into subpopulations or _________. 


Groups  



Division  



``Strata``



Elements  




### 3. Question 3
### Each element of the population should be allocated to one and only one _________stratum and no population elements should be omitted.


Item  



Group



Element  



``Stratum``



### 4. Question 4
### In _________ sampling the target population is initially divided to mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive subpopulations. 


Stratified 



``Cluster ``



Systematic 



Single Random




### 1. Question 1
### To define the ____________ focuses on the collection of elements which possess the information that is sought by the researcher.


``Target population``
_(Correct:
The correct answer is target population, because in order to define the target population focuses on the collection of elements which possess the information that is sought by the researcher.)_


Target aim



Sample



Items



Research 





### 2. Question 2
### A(n) ___________ refers to the representation of the various elements of the target population. It consists of a set of guidelines in specifying the target population.


Population 



Target 



Item 



Element 



``Sampling frame``
_(Correct:
The correct answer is sampling frame, because a sampling frame refers to the representation of the various elements of the target population. It consists of a set of guidelines in specifying the target population)_


### 3. Question 3
### Non response error appears when some of the potential key informants included in the sample do not respond.


``True``



False 




### 4. Question 4
### In single random sampling the known and equal probability is calculated as follows: Probability of selection=sample size/population size.


``True``
_(Correct:
This is true because in single random sampling the known and equal probability is calculated as follows: Probability of selection=sample size/population size.)_


False 





### 5. Question 5
### _______________sampling is a probability sample which is distinguished by the following processes: the original population is divided into two or more mutually exclusive and exhaustive subsets (e.g., males and females) and simple random samples of elements from two or more subsets are selected independently of each other.


Simple random



Judgemental  



``Stratified ``
_(Correct:
The correct answer is stratified because stratified sampling is a probability sample which is distinguished by the following processes: the original population is divided into two or more mutually exclusive and exhaustive subsets (e.g., males and females) and simple random samples of elements from two or more subsets are selected independently of each other.)_
