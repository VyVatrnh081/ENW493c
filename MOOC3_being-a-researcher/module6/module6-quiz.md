### 1. Question 1
### Which of the following statements on ethics are correct? Tick them.

``Misconducts can differ in severity.``

Ethics is the philosophical study of beauty and taste.

``A misconduct is a deviation from ethical principles.``

``Ethics is the philosophical study of wrong and right conduct, according to an ideal model.``

Ethical principles do not apply to scientific research.


### 2. Question 2
### Which of the following statements on research misconduct are correct? Tick them.


``Manually tweaking some experimental results to make experiments look better is a case of falsification misconduct.``

A falsification misconduct may consist of designing experiments that try to falsify a theory. 

``A submitted paper that reports fabricated data must be rejected.``

Fabrication is a research misconduct that refers to artifacts. It means that an artifact has defects and cannot be reused by other researchers.

``Reporting results of a made-up experiment that has never been done is a case of fabrication misconduct.``



### 3. Question 3
### Which of the following statements on plagiarism (đạo văn) are correct? Tick them.

``Including in a paper fragments of text from a paper by other authors, without giving credit, is an example of plagiarism.``

Including figures from other papers can be done without giving credit. Copying figures is not a case of plagiarism.

Whatever is found on electronic archives through Web browsing can be freely included in own papers without incurring in plagiarism.

Plagiarism consists of not explicitly citing a highly related previously published paper.

An author is allowed to copy text portions from a previous own paper into a new paper and is not required to cite the original paper. Because these texts are from the same author, this is not a case of plagiarism.



### 4. Question 4

``You review a paper in an area in which you are active and have already published.

A visiting researcher in your department gives a seminar on her on-going work and mentions a conjecture. She believes that a mathematical proof exists for it, but has not properly demonstrated it. You come out with a proof and submit a paper without citing her idea.


``One of your junior colleagues will soon be evaluated for promotion to a tenured position, and needs to strengthen his CV with more publications. To help him, you tell your PhD student who has done very good work to write a paper which includes also your colleague as a co-author, although he has not contributed.``

One of your students helped you in implementing a simulation, whose results will appear in the experimental section of your paper. He is not listed as a co-author, but you decide to explicitly mention her in an acknowledgements section.
