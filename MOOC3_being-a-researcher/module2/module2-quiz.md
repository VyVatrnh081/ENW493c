### 1. Question 1
### Tick one or more of the following statements, which properly describes the scientific method, originated in the 17th century by scientists like Galileo, Newton, and others.

The method is based on validation of a theory by randomly generated experiments.

The method requires explaining the natural phenomenon under study avoiding the use of mathematics

``The method consists of observing a natural phenomenon under study, postulating a theory that explains it, and devising carefully chosen experiments to confirm or disprove the theory.``
_(Phương pháp này bao gồm việc quan sát một hiện tượng tự nhiên đang nghiên cứu, đưa ra giả thuyết giải thích hiện tượng đó và thiết kế các thí nghiệm được lựa chọn cẩn thận để xác nhận hoặc bác bỏ lý thuyết đó.)_

The method is purely theoretical, and does not require any experiments.

The method assures that a certain theory explaining a natural phenomenon is valid (i.e., it is an undisputable truth) after carefully chosen experiments confirm it.


### 2. Question 2
### What is a null hypothesis? Tick the correct answer.

Hypothesis that further experiments disprove.

No hypothesis made.

Hypothesis made by inexperienced scientist.

``Hypothesis framed in a negative form, which researchers try to reject to confirm a theory.``
_(Giả thuyết được trình bày theo dạng phủ định, mà các nhà nghiên cứu cố gắng bác bỏ để xác nhận một giả thuyết.)_

An obviously wrong hypothesis that does not explain a certain phenomenon.

### 3. Question 3
### A scientific theory… (tick one)

Must always be described as a set of mathematical formulae.

``Is valid until further findings disprove it.``
_(Có giá trị cho đến khi các phát hiện tiếp theo bác bỏ nó.)_

Is valid if a majority vote of researchers approves it.

Must be stated as an absolute truth. It is guaranteed that it will never be falsified by further experiments.

Is guaranteed to be unfalsifiable when it is published.


### 4. Question 4
### Deduction vs. induction _(diễn dịch vs. quy nạp)_. Tick the correct statements:

In deductive inference, the consequences of true premises must be further validated by experiments before they can be accepted as a truth.

Inductive inferences always lead to necessary conclusions.

``Modus ponens is a typical deductive inference rule.``
_(Modus ponens là một quy tắc suy luận diễn dịch điển hình)_

``In deductive inference, the consequences are guaranteed to be true if premises are true.``
_(Trong suy luận diễn dịch, hậu quả được đảm bảo là đúng nếu các tiền đề đúng.)_

``Deductive inferences can be used to generate predictions from a given theory.``
_(Suy luận diễn dịch có thể được sử dụng để tạo ra các dự đoán từ một lý thuyết nhất định.)_


### 5. Question 5
### Consider the following statements:  

- All beans in the bag are white **a**

- These beans are from the bag **b**

- These beans are white **c**
 

### Which of the following statements about inferences are correct?

The inference rule a ∧c ⊢ b is an deduction and leads to a necessary conclusion.

``The inference rule a ∧c ⊢ b is an induction and leads to a non-necessary conclusion.``

The inference rule b ∧c ⊢ a is a deduction and leads to a necessary conclusion.

``The inference rule b ∧c ⊢ a is an induction and leads to a non-necessary conclusion.``
_(Nếu những hạt này là từ túi (b), và chúng có màu trắng (c), ta không thể chắc chắn kết luận rằng tất cả các hạt trong túi đều trắng (a).)_

``The inference rule a ∧ b ⊢ c is a deduction and leads to a necessary conclusion.``
_( Nếu tất cả các hạt trong túi là trắng (a) và các hạt này đến từ túi đó (b), thì kết luận rằng những hạt đậu này là màu trắng (c))_



### 6. Question 6
### Soundness vs. completeness _(đúng đắn vs. đầy đủ)_ of a theory of a certain phenomenon. Tick the correct statements.

``A theory for a given phenomenon is complete if it predicts all the possible manifestations.``
_(Một giả thuyết là đầy đủ nếu nó có thể dự đoán được mọi khả năng có thể xảy ra – tức là không bỏ sót điều gì đúng.)_

A theory for a given phenomenon is complete if all its predictions are possible manifestations of the phenomenon.

``A theory for a given phenomenon is sound if all its predictions are possible manifestations of the phenomenon.``
_(Một giả thuyết là đúng đắn nếu mọi điều nó dự đoán đều là sự thật – tức là không có dự đoán sai)_

``Ideally, a theory should be both sound and complete.``

A complete theory for a given phenomenon can predict impossible manifestations.



### 7. Question 7
### Consider an algorithm that is supposed to find all possible occurrences in a text of person’s names. We are aware of the difficulty of the problem, and we expect the algorithm to provide an approximate solution. In some cases, understanding whether a word represents a person’s name may in fact require deep semantic understanding of the text. Being an approximation, the algorithm may provide false positives and false negatives. Which of the following statements are correct?

The algorithm may both find a name that is not a person’s name and may fail to find the occurrence of certain person’s names. In this case the algorithm is simply an unacceptable approximation.

``The algorithm finds a name that is not a person’s name. This is a false positive.``

``The algorithm may find a name that is not a person’s name and may fail to find the occurrence of certain person’s names. In this case the algorithm can generate both false positives and false negatives.``

The algorithm does not find the occurrence of certain person’s names. This is a false positive.

The algorithm finds a name that is not a person’s name. This is a false negative.

### 8. Question 8
### Consider the following statements about precision and recall of an algorithm. Which are correct?


``If we are given two approximate algorithms for the same problem, they can they differ in precision and recall.``

``Precision is less than one for algorithms that compute false positives.``

``Recall is less than one for algorithms that produce false negatives.``

Either precision or recall must be equal to one for an approximate algorithm to be acceptable.

``Precision and recall are equal to one for algorithms computing exact solutions.``



### 9. Question 9
### Consider the following statements about case studies in research. Tick the pertinent answers.

A case study is a study of a legal action.

A case study never requires threat analysis.

``Threat analysis should be applied to assess internal and external validity of the conclusions drawn from a case study.``

``A case study may concern the use of a proposed new artifact or method in a given context to validate its usability in a practical setting.``

A case study is never applied in research. It is only used as a didactic aid.
