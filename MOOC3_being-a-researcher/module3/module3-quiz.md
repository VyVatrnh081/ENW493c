### 1. Question 1
### You are asked to review a _survey paper_. In which of the following dimensions you are _not expecting_ the paper to be particularly strong? Tick one.  

``Originality`` _(tính độc đáo)_
_(Survey paper: tổng hợp, phân tích các nghiên cứu đã có sẵn -> không đưa ra kết quả mới)_

Significance

Rigor

### 2. Question 2
### You are asked to review a _theoretical research paper_. In which of the following quality dimensions you _expect_ the paper to be particularly strong? Tick one.

Originality

``Rigor`` _(tính chính xác)_
_(theoretical research paper: bài nghiên cứu lý thuyết, thường liên quan đến mô hình, định lý, chứng minh, v.v. Do đó, yếu tố quan trọng nhất là tính chặt chẽ trong lập luận, công thức và phương pháp. Không chặt chẽ thì lý thuyết sẽ sai lệch hoặc không có giá trị.)_

Significance


### 3. Question 3
### The following statements are about journal and conference publication (xuất bản báo chí và hội nghị). Tick the ones that are valid:

``In certain scientific areas conferences and journals are equally selective and respected publication venues.``

Journals are always more selective and prestigious venues than conferences.

``The publication process for journals normally takes longer than for conferences, and duration can be unpredictable.``

The publication process for conferences normally takes longer than for journals, and duration can be unpredictable.

Conference publication has no scientific value. It is only done as a social activity. This is true for all scientific areas.


### 4. Question 4
### The publication process relies on peer review (quá trình phản biện). Which of the following statements are valid? Tick them.

``The goal of peer review is to ensure that published results meet certain quality standards.``
_(đảm bảo kết quả được công bố đạt tiêu chuẩn chất lượng.)_

To reach better insights into a submitted paper, it is advisable that peer review is delegated to close colleagues of the authors, especially those who have been previous collaborators.

``Peer review is a voluntary service activity done to support the research community.``
_(hoạt động tình nguyện để hỗ trợ cộng đồng nghiên cứu.)_

To avoid bias, peer reviewers should not be experts in the field of the contribution.

The main goal of peer review is to ensure proper balance among different nationalities of contributors of accepted papers.


### 5. Question 5
### Which of the following are valid statements about peer review? Tick them.

The typical situation is that the author of a paper knows the identity of peer reviewers and interacts with them throughout the review process, if necessary.

``The typical situation is that the identity of reviewers is unknown to the author of a submitted paper.``
_(single-blinded review)_


A “double blind” review process allows authors to submit two related papers to the same venue and have them reviewed by the same set of anonymous reviewers.

``In a “double blind” review process not only the identity of the reviewers is undisclosed to the authors, but also the identity of the authors is hidden to the reviewers, to reduce bias.``
_(double-blinded review)_

A “double blind” review process requires exactly two anonymous reviewers for each submitted paper.



### 6. Question 6
### Which of the following are valid statements about publications? Tick them.


Publication has a legal purpose: it ensures 100% correctness of the reported results.

The only possible form of publication is in printed form.

``Every published book is uniquely identified by its ISBN.``

``Most professional societies publish journals and conference proceedings in their respective technical areas.``

``A DOI allows unique access to digital objects, including papers and datasets.``


### 7. Question 7
### Which of the following statements about research artifacts (thành phẩm nghiên cứu) are valid? Tick them.

Research artifacts, such as datasets, software tools, or simulations, only serve an ancillary purpose in the preparation of a paper and should be kept private. They have no use for others.


``Making artifacts publicly available requires additional effort by researchers. As a benefit, their research may become more visible and their research impactful.``

``Research artifacts can be an essential complement to papers as a form of research diffusion.``

``Repeatability and replicability of research is supported by sharing artifacts.``

Peer review only applies to papers. Artifacts cannot be peer reviewed.


### 8. Question 8
### Which of the following statements about Open Access are valid? Tick them.

The notion of Open Access only applies to research papers and not to artifacts.

No implementation of Open Access can charge a fee to a researcher to publish her product.

Open Access means that a research product is accessible on-line in digital form, only subject to a minimal access fee.

In an Open Access scheme, authors can publish papers without undergoing any form of peer review.

``Open Access means that a research product is accessible on-line in digital form, free of charge, and free of “most” copyright and licensing restrictions.``
_(nghiên cứu được truy cập miễn phí, không rào cản bản quyền lớn, và dễ dàng chia sẻ lại, phù hợp với các tiêu chuẩn như của Budapest Open Access Initiative.)_


### 9. Question 9
###  Gold vs Green Open Access: which statements are correct? Tick them.

``A Green Open Access journal allows the author to publish a paper and then self-archive a copy in a freely accessible institutional or specialist online archive (e.g., arXiv), or on the personal website.``
_(tác giả có thể tự lưu trữ (self-archive) bài báo sau khi được xuất bản chính thức, trên kho lưu trữ như arXiv, institutional repository hay trang cá nhân.)_

A Green Open Access journal allows the author to publish a paper l and then charge for accessing the related artifacts.

``Gold Open Access means that the author publishes his or her work on an Open Access journal, which makes the work immediately, publicly, and freely available to others.``
_(bài báo được xuất bản và truy cập miễn phí ngay lập tức bởi bất kỳ ai.)_

Gold Open Access is a special label indicating the most downloaded papers from an online archive.

A Green Open Access journal allows the author to publish a paper and share it with a selected set of people who must register to get access to it.
