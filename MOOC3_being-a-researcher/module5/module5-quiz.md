### 1. Question 1
### A junior researcher, after the PhD and a short period as a post-doc, applies for junior tenure-track position in an academic institution. Reference letters are asked to external experts. Tick the items in the following list which are expected to be in a reference letter.


``Comparison of scientific achievements of the candidate with top individuals in the same field with similar seniority.``

Comments on the applicant’s personal life (e.g., family, hobbies, …).

``A justified opinion about the candidate’s potential to become a research leader in his/her area.``

``In the case where the expert is an editor of a journal and the candidate acted as a peer reviewer, comments on how accurate and helpful the reviews were.``

``Comments on the applicant’s presentation skills based on personal experience (e.g., having heard the candidate present in a conference or in a seminar).``


### 2. Question 2
### Consider the case where a researcher applies for promotion from a non-permanent to a permanent academic position. The following statements refer to reference letters asked to external experts to support the promotion case. Tick the pertinent statements.


Reference letters should only be asked to scientists who have worked directly with the candidate  in the past.

The applicant can suggest names of potential external reviewers and should select among scientists from other institutions who are not familiar with his work.

Reference letters should never comment on the candidate’s performance as a peer reviewer. 

``Reference letter should contain an assessment of the candidate’s proven skills as a supervisor and mentor of younger researchers.``

``The applicant can suggest names of potential external reviewers and should select well known and respected scientists who are familiar with his work and who are likely to express a positive opinion.``


### 3. Question 3
### Which of the following statements on paper citations are valid? Tick them.


The number of citations received by a paper precisely measures impact of the research presented in a paper. If two papers have different numbers of citations, the one with a higher number has more scientific impact than the other.


The previous statement is true if we exclude self-citations


``The sole number of citations received by a paper does not offer any ground for judgement about its quality.``


The previous statement is true if we also assume that the two papers have been published in the same venue and in the same year.


``A paper which did not receive citations, or only received a few, ten years after publication is likely to have very low significance. This, however, has to be confirmed by further scrutiny.``


### 4. Question 4
### Which of the following statements on Impact Factor (IF) are valid? Tick them.

IF for a journal is a constant value. It does not change over time.


If two papers are published by journals with different IF, the paper published in the journal with higher IF has a higher quality.

IF is an objective and undisputable measure of the scientific reputation of a journal and should replace any subjective judgement of experts. If two journals have even slightly different IF values, a researcher should always try to publish in the one with higher IF.

IF cannot be applied to conferences.

``IF is an aggregate bibliometric indicator which is ultimately based the citations of papers published in a journal or conference.``


### 5. Question 5
### Which of the following statements on H-index are valid? Tick them.


H-index for a researcher X is defined as the average value h of citations received by all published papers by the researcher in the past ten years.


``H-index is a bibliometric indicator that applies to researchers.``


H-index is an objective and undisputable measure of the scientific quality of researchers and should replace any subjective judgement of experts, especially when they are involved in hiring or promotion processes. If two candidates have different H-index values, the one with higher H-index should always be ranked higher.


H-index for a researcher X is defined as the median value h of citations received by all published papers by the researcher in the past ten years.


``H-index for a researcher X is defined as the maximum value of h such that X has published h papers that have each been cited at least h times.``
_(định nghĩa chuẩn về H-index: Một nhà nghiên cứu có H-index = h nếu có h bài báo đã được trích dẫn ít nhất h lần.)_


### 6. Question 6
### Which of the following statements on quantitative evaluation (đánh giá định lượng) via bibliometrics are valid? Tick them.

Bibliometric indicators have no bias: they are objective, undisputable, and cannot be tweaked.


A strength of bibliometrics is that all sources of bibliometric data (such as Google Scholar, ISI Web of Science, and Scopus) provide identical values for the same item (e.g., H-index).


Bibliometric data are especially valuable for cross-sector comparisons. For example, to decide about allocation of funding among very different sectors (such as Mechanical Engineering or Biology) a reasonable choice might be to assess the average quality of researchers in the different sectors (e.g., averaging H-indexes) and allocate funding accordingly.


``Bibliometric indicators can be used to inform evaluation, but should never be a substitute for personal, detailed, and rigorous judgement by experts.``
_(Các chỉ số có thể hỗ trợ quá trình đánh giá, nhưng không nên thay thế hoàn toàn sự đánh giá chuyên môn của các nhà nghiên cứu, hội đồng, hoặc chuyên gia. )_

Ultimately, bibliometric indicators are automatically computed numbers and may be used for automatic ranking. Despite minor pitfalls, they are always preferable to human judgement.
